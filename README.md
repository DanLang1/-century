# Chat App - Next.js

This is a little web app I setup to learn Next.js and talk with my friends. Uses Supabase on the backend, Mantine as component library, and Ably for chat functionality

- Full auth setup with support for anonymous users so no account creation is needed to start chatting. And if you decide to create an account later, your information is saved (as long as the anonymous user cookie still exists in your browser)
- Emoji reactions, typing indicators, and presence indicators along with a few other features inspired by games I've played with friends over the years
- Mostly just a playground to test some things in, may evolve to become more than just a chat app some point in the future
